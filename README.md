## Smart Dashboard

Based on [`FRC Dashboard`](https://frcdashboard.github.io/).

### Setup
* If you haven't done so already, install the dependencies:
    * [`nodejs`](https://nodejs.org)
    * [`npm`](https://npmjs.com)

* In the dashboard directory, run `npm install`

### Building
1. `cd` into the dashboard directory
2. Run `npm i` to install all of the dependencies
3. Run `npm run dist` to pack the entire application into a single file

### Running
While in the dashboard directory, type `npm start`.
